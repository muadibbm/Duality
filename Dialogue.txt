AFTER THE INITIAL CINEMATIC 
Oh no! The anti-matter reAGENT has escaped...on your watch too...
How could it have possibly gotten out of captivity?

AFTER THE GROUND SHATTERS IN FRONT OF YOU
Be careful! It's a lot stronger than it looks and apparently it is aware that you are in pursuit.

Something is definitely different ever since it touched you on its way out. 
The very fabric of the universe seems hazy ... almost as if you can feel the never-before-seen anti-matter universe all around you.
Press 'E' for a startling realization.

UPON SWITCHING TO ANTI-MATTER FOR THE FIRST TIME
What's this?! This must be the anti-matter universe. It looks familiar somehow...even though no matter particle has ever admitted to seeing it.
The infiniteness is almost overwhelming. 

Maybe crossing that platform that came from the abyss could lead to a way back.

AFTER CROSSING THE FIRST DARK-MATTER PLATFORM
What a strange glowing portal... Could that be the way back to the matter universe?

AFTER SEEING THE FIRST PLATFORM FALL DUE TO A FALLING BOULDER
Look out! The reAGENT is destroying the molecule and causing bonds to fall - destroying the path. Maybe if somehow there was a way to get back to the anti-matter universe...

WHEN GOING TO THE ANTI-MATTER UNIVERSE FOR THE SECOND TIME
Woah. Looks like this universe is not nearly as stable as what you've grown accustomed to.



RANDOM LOCATION SWITCH
This region looks completely different than where you came from. Maybe not all areas of the two universes are similar.
